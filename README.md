# Real time face mask detection system
In the age of Covid-19, face masks and social distancing have become the new normal.Indoor places, such as restaurants and grocery stores, are legally required to have rules in place for the mandatory use of face masks. Having a worker manually examining each person to make sure their mask is on simply defeats the goal of limiting contact with people as much as possible. So, a real-time face mask detection system can be used to address this issue that will not only maximize efficiency but will also ensure to potentially save lives.
This machine learning model will then determine whether or not a face mask is worn in real-time. Based on the performance and accuracy of this model, the result of the binary classifier will be indicated by showing a green rectangle superimposed around the section of the face indicating that the person at the camera is wearing a mask, or a red rectangle indicating that the person on camera is not wearing a mask.
